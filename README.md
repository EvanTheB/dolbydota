dolbydota
=========

attempt to make an interface between dota 2 and dolby axon with an end goal of being able to automatically position in dolby based on the position in dota

I have hacked in a dota addon mode that does the basic functionality. I dont know windows pipes so I am just writing to a file in \ and reading from that in the axon script.

I think the lua winapi was from this. But I forget
